# AUTISM_PROJECT
Project on python

Requirements will vary based on dependencies

The project is configured to connect to an SQL database using MySQL Workbench. If the database is not set up correctly on your system, the database-dependent functionalities may not work as expected.
Please ensure that you have MySQL Workbench installed and properly configured, or update the database connection settings according to your local setup.

The repository includes the training data and scripts for all models used in the project.
However, only one trained model is attached for reference and testing purposes. If you need to use other models, you may need to train them using the provided scripts.
